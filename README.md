# IPO-Group-Creator-Tool
This application is aimed at students and faculty at the university to easily manage the creation and assignment of working groups.

This is just a demo and so it does not connect to a real database yet. It simulates the database creating 2 'txt' files, one for students and the other one for teachers. Into that files we can find the logins for the teachers and students that the application creates automatically.
