# IPO-Group-Creator-Tool
This application is aimed at students and faculty at the university to easily manage the creation and assignment of working groups.

This is just a demo and cannot connect with a real database yet, so it simulates the database creating 2 .txt files, one for students and the other one for techer. Into that files we can find the logins for the techers and students that the application creates automatically.
